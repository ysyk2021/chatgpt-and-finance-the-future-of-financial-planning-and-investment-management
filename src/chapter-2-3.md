Financial Planning
------------------

Financial planning involves creating a comprehensive plan to achieve an individual's financial goals. There are several types of financial planning techniques used today:

### Cash Flow Planning

Cash flow planning involves analyzing income and expenses to determine how much money is available for savings, investments, and other financial goals. This type of planning can help individuals identify areas where they can reduce expenses or increase income to achieve their financial goals.

### Retirement Planning

Retirement planning involves creating a plan to ensure that an individual has enough money saved to retire comfortably. This type of planning typically involves analyzing current retirement savings, estimating future retirement expenses, and identifying strategies to maximize retirement income.

### Estate Planning

Estate planning involves creating a plan to distribute assets after an individual's death. This type of planning typically involves creating a will, establishing trusts, and minimizing estate taxes.

Investment Management
---------------------

Investment management involves managing an individual's investment portfolio to achieve their financial goals. There are several types of investment management techniques used today:

### Active Management

Active management involves actively buying and selling investments in an attempt to outperform the market. This type of management typically involves higher fees and requires more time and expertise than passive management.

### Passive Management

Passive management involves investing in a diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This type of management seeks to match the performance of the overall market rather than trying to outperform it.

### Socially Responsible Investing (SRI)

Socially responsible investing involves investing in companies that have positive social or environmental impacts. This type of investing can be done through mutual funds, ETFs, or individual stocks.
